State the Problem Before Describing the Solution

After several years of writing papers in computer science, 
I discovered the basic expository rule embodied in the title of
this note . As obvious as this rule may seem, there are fields in
which it is seldom observed . (Computer networking is one
example .) A typical paper in such a field is organized as follows :

(1) a brief informal statement of the problem ;
(2) the solution ;
(3) a statement and proof of the precise correctness properties satisfied by the solution.

In order to abide by the rule, the following organization should instead be used :
(1) a brief informal statement of the problem ;
(2) the precise correctness conditions required of a solution ;
(3) the solution ;
(4) a proof that the solution satisfies the requisite conditions.
Although it may not be obvious at first glance, there is a profound 
difference between these two approaches . In the first, the precise 
correctness conditions can be (and usually are)
stated in terms of the solution itself . Some results are proved
about the solution, but it is often not clear exactly what problem is
being solved . This makes the comparison of two different solutions 
rather difficult . With the second approach , one is forced to specify
the precise problem to be solved independently of the method used in
the solution . This can be a surprisingly difficult and enlightening task.
It has on several occasions led me to discover that a "correct" algorithm 
did not really accomplish what I wanted it to . I strongly urge everyone
to observe the rule .

(I am ignoring as unworthy of consideration the disturbingly
large number of papers that never even attempt a precis e
statement of what problem they are solving.)
